#project My goal is to make a bot of python script that
# will count up all the users who chatted durning the
# live stream, then add them to a list count up their
# total comments and add it up so that we can determine
# most active stranger and present them as the perfect
# Stranger

# then we will make an animation to thank 1st, 2nd,
# and 3rd place while making fun of everyone else? lol
